@DATE@ - DocFetcher @VERSION@
---------------------------------------------
Features:
  * French GUI translation.
  * German manual translation.
  * DocFetcher now runs on KDE.
  * DocFetcher can be used as a command line text extraction tool (experimental feature). See project wiki for more info: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/docfetcher/

Bugfixes:
  * Bug #2811753: Backslashes in the custom exclusion patterns weren't correctly saved (only one backslash instead of two), thus after restart all backslashes were gone. Also, Unicode characters in the preferences weren't handled correctly.
  * When the installed Linux version crashed, it unsuccessfully tried to write the stacktrace to /usr/share/docfetcher. This has been corrected to ~/.docfetcher.
  * Bug #2792186: Crash because DocFetcher was trying to display a message box when there's no active shell.
  * Bug #2791378: Crash when trying to list file extensions in a directory DocFetcher has no access to.
  * DocFetcher crashed with an OutOfMemoryError when the progress panel contained too much text.
  * Bug #2807587: DocFetcher freezed when there were many indexes and/or result items and the user checked or unchecked items on the left panel.
  * The Linux launch script of the portable version was missing an executable flag.
  * Bug #2911343 and #2924235: XPCOM error on Linux due to incompatibility between latest version of XULRunner and SWT 3.4. Fixed by upgrading to SWT 3.5.
  * Bug #2881245 and #2925127: Random Lucene-related crash.
  * JNotify replaced with newest version, fixes crashes on Windows that occur after removing two or more indexes.
  * Temporary workaround for bug #2916975 and bug #2829490: DocFetcher could run out of image handles when trying to display too many file icons on the result panel.
  * Bug #2904322: When the user selects "copy to clipboard" on the error table of the indexing dialog, but no items are selected, DocFetcher crashed.
  * No daemon-based index updates when indexed folder is inside DocFetcher folder.

Changes:
  * Feature Request #2788390: With the user.properties entry "AllowRepositoryModification" one can disable all context menu entries that modify the document repositories.
  * Feature Request #2812668: Option to save the search history on exit.
  * Sorting of results by title, filename and path takes numberings into account (e.g. file12 > file2).
  * When DocFetcher crashes, a more informative stacktrace is shown.
  * Search scope panel displays paths of indexed folders in dark grey.
  * Default maximum heap size increased to 256 MB. This will make it less likely that DocFetcher runs out of memory during indexing.
  * Manual updated. Parts of it were moved to the new project wiki: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/docfetcher/
  * All libraries updated (except Apache Lucene).
